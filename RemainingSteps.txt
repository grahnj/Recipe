Notes

JG 4.14.2015.19.19.00.000 - UPDATE query thoughts
  We may need to consider how a user will delete an object from their ingredient list.
  I thought of this while brainstorming UPDATE queries and how we should handle submitting ingredients.

  If we do offer them the ability to delete, we should handle update and delete tasks per ingredient
  --I think the smoothest way to implement this will be one at a time, but refetching the data could be tricky.
  --Perhaps we can just rerun our code that populates the list everytime add an ingredient?

JG 4.14.2015.19.25.00.000 - DB changes
  My select queries do not quite match with the DB -- I thought i was missing a few important pieces. Noting my changes needed.
  -Rename NUMBER in STEP to STEP_NUMBER
  -Add Columns in MEASUREMENT_TYPE and MEASUREMENT_VALUE to get the numerical constant for each, called NAME_VALUE
